curriculum_fields
=================

This is a small Drupal module that provides three fields for a schools curriculum project that I am developing.  The fields are: Learning Objective Environmental Constraint Qualification Level  They currently provide their most basic functionality and are minimalistic on their use of hooks, only implementing those needed to do the job. I will be fleshing this out, adding tweeks and functionality as the curriculum module progresses and develops requiring more from these fields. Most of the drupal ground work for multi-field implementation has been taken care of and this works out of the box with no dependencies so is a good example module for learning fields or for a refresher reference.
